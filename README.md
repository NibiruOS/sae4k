# Simple Adventure Engine for Korge
This is a simple, ugly and very buggy adventure engine for [Korge](https://korge.org/) (Work In Progress, in other words, haha).

## Sample
* [Running app](https://nibiruos.github.io/sae4k-sample/)
* [Source code](src/commonMain/kotlin/sample) 

## Open topics
* Implement a priority queue for A* search
* Solve path search bugs!
* Implement a more efficient z-index simulation. 
* Refactor:
  * Floor - Character - Scenario dependency (maybe changing responsibilities)
  * Actors are exposing sprites
